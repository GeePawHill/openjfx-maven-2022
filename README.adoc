# OpenJfx + Maven + IntelliJ 2022

This is a starter project. It includes one JavaFx application in `Main`, and a single and meaningless -- but runnable JUnit 5 test.

This is for:

* OpenJdk 18
* OpenJfx 18
* Junit 5.8.1
* AssertJ 3.23

It includes two run configurations, "test" and "run", which do just about what you think.

The key "support files":

*    pom.xml
**        Includes the openjfx plugin
* module-info.java
**        This file is required to allow intellij to do "native" runs.
* The Run Configurations
** These are in .../.idea/runConfigurations/
** run.xml
** test.xml

In theory, this project will run out of the box, assuming you have OpenJDK installed and either Maven installed or the intellij maven built-in turned on.
